# CS-250 Final Sprint Review and Journal Reflection

## Project Overview
This repository contains my final submission for the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course. It includes my Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU Travel Project, as well as a personal reflection journal addressing essential Computer Science program questions.

## Portfolio Artifact
- **Sprint Review and Retrospective:** A comprehensive reflection on my experience acting as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Tester in a simulated Agile environment.
- **Journal Reflection:** A summary of lessons learned throughout the course and how I plan to apply Agile practices in future projects.

## Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?**  
User stories help turn vague requests into focused development goals. The “so that I…” section makes sure we’re building with purpose and not just checking boxes.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I prefer short feedback loops, user-driven priorities, and regular check-ins. Agile practices like Daily Scrums and Retrospectives make the process adaptable and keep the team aligned.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
It means being proactive, communicating clearly, and helping your team succeed. Whether it’s asking for clarity, removing blockers, or stepping into different roles, the goal is to build trust and momentum.
